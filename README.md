# Wrike Integration Project

This project integrates with Wrike's API to fetch tasks, map them, and save them to a `tasks.json` file. The file will be automatically generated by running the application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20/v22)
  
## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AvetisyanJen/WrikeIntegrations.git
   cd WrikeIntegrations
2. **Install dependencies:**
   To install project dependencies, run the following command:
   `npm install`
   
   Additionally, install nodemon for automatic reloading during development:
   
   `npm i nodemon`
3. **Create a .env file:**
   In the root directory of the project, create a .env file to store your sensitive API credentials:
   `WRIKE_TOKEN=your_wrike_api_token`
   
   Replace your_wrike_api_token with your actual Wrike API token.

4. **Add tasks.json to .gitignore:**

##Running the Project
To run the project and generate the tasks.json file, follow these steps:
##Start the development server with Nodemon:

The easiest way to run the project in development mode with automatic restarts on changes is by using Nodemon. Run the following command:
``nodemon``

The tasks will be fetched from the Wrike API, mapped, and saved to tasks.json.

After running the project, you should see the tasks.json file generated in your project root. This file will contain the tasks retrieved from the Wrike API.
